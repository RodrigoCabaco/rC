# rC

Open Source Programming Language Created By Rodrigo Cabaço =) This is a free and totaly open source compiler with rC built-in. Feel free to use it!


Newest Update Changes:

In a for loop make sure to not leave spaces between expressions;

EX:     
- for x in range % 5 $>f++ $>WriteNum &>f<&    
- output: 00000    
EX2:       
- for x in range % 5 $>f++$>WriteNum &>f<&    
- output: 12345    

Added Commands:
- load >> filename.rcode
- compiler.load >> filename.rcode
- quit
- save(this) as filename (no .rcode)
- create_project projectName
- upgrade_project projectPath
- restore_project projectPath
- run_project (when inside project directory)
- create_file filename


New Methods:

- sleep >> miliseconds

Currently Working On:

- If Statements
- While Statements
- var = var + var <-- attributing variables its own value + other variable
