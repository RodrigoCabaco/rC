# rC
Open Source Programming Language Created By Rodrigo Cabaço =)
This is a free and totaly open source compiler with rC built-in.
Feel free to use it!




Docs and Methods:


Variable defenitions:

string:
str name >> value
  
  
  
number:
number name >> value


Output / Write:



Write &>something to print <&



Writing a string:
WriteStr &> variable name <&



Writing a number:
WriteNum &> variable name <&
                               
PLEASE NOTE THAT EVERY THING YOU WRITE STAYS ON THE SAME LINE UNTIL YOU WRITE "newline"!
example:


str name >> rodrigo  
str age >> 12  
Write &>My name and age are: <&  
newline  
WriteStr &>name<&  
WriteNum &>age<&  

Output:
My name and age are: 
rodrigo 12





example 2:
str name >> rodrigo
str age >> 12
Write &>My name and age are: <&
WriteStr &>name<&
WriteNum &>age<&

Output:
My name and age are: rodrigo 12

-----------------------------------------------------------
FOR statements:

for x in range % 3 $>Write &>hi<& &>newline

output:
hi
hi
hi

if statements:

number me >>12
number f >>12
if (me<-f) $>Write &>true<& &else ->Write &>false<&
if (me<=f) $>Write &>true<& &else ->Write &>false<&
if (me+>f) $>Write &>true<& &else ->Write &>false<&

notes: > = +>
       < = <-

num + num:

number me >>12
number him >>13

me*him

WriteNum &>me<&

output:
156

Modifying a Line:

line.modify(line number): new line content




Saving and outputing your code to a log:
